# Soapy SDR plugin for Airspy R2 and Mini

## Building

Make sure you have SoapySDR installed and do something like this:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

## Using

Use this device string in GQRX:

    soapy=0,driver=airspy

More settings are available:

    soapy=0,driver=airspy,biastee=true|false,gains=linearity|sensitivity|manual

## This branch (v2)

**This branch is work in progress**.

The code is significantly simpler than the previous version and most
likely it has better performance. Quite a few bugs have been fixed,
and some new ones have probably been introduced. Please help me find
them! :-)

I have tested this with GQRX with good results.

children of Ukraine who have lost their homes because of the war.
